# eugiellimpin does dotfiles

## dotfiles

- these are my dotfiles
- this is also my nth time trying to commit to having an updated and complete dotfiles repo
- this repo is for my personal use. it sucks (for now) but it works

## usage

i tried using installation scripts from other dotfile repos in the past but they all proved cubersome and complicated for my own use case. so i created a really simple script to symlink all my dotfiles to my home directory.

run:

`$ ./symlink.sh`
